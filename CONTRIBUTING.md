# Contributing

If you use the project and miss something or find a bug, we're happy to accept 
[pull requests](https://github.com/meridium/episerver.migration/pulls)!

If you follow the these rules, it is more likely that your request will be merged

- Write clear commit messages describing what you have done
- If you fixed an issue, remember to reference the issue in the commit message
- Unit tests are nice but not a requirement. The test project uses [Xunit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) 
as the test framework and [NFluent](https://github.com/tpierrain/NFluent) for assertions.

Use [issues](https://github.com/meridium/episerver.migration/issues) to report bugs or feature requests. 
Meridium developers will probably only fix stuff in this repository when we're working on a migration project.
